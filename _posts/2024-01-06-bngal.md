I am very pleased to announce the release of my tool BNGAL, a network analysis-driven solution to microbial niche identification. BNGAL comprises both an [R package](https://github.com/mselensky/bngal) and standalone [command line tool](https://github.com/mselensky/bngal-cli) for microbial community network construction from taxonomic count tables. BNGAL comes from spending much of my PhD stumbling through the analysis of community-level statistics with [16S rRNA gene datasets](https://www.illumina.com/areas-of-interest/microbiology/microbial-sequencing-methods/16s-rrna-sequencing.html), which are still very commonly used in the field of microbial ecology. I often found myself in situations where I would [go through the trouble of identifying microbes from 16S data](https://github.com/NU-OsburnLab/Example_Scripts/tree/main/16S_pipeline_qiime2), and then I wouldn't even know where to start for the real fun: getting a systems-level understanding of the potential community structure. I am excited enough about its release that I used it as an excuse to revive my long-slumbering website. :)

If you ever find BNGAL helpful for your research, please consider citing [our recent paper](https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01682-23) that used this tool!
