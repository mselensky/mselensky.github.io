Hi there, I'm Matt - I love science, computers, and people! 

I am a high-performance computing (HPC) professional currently working at [Northwestern University](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/). As a [Computational Specialist](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/staff/selensky.html), I consult with high-impact researchers to efficiently scale their scientific code on a 1,000+ node Linux cluster. I pride myself on facilitating access to advanced computing technologies, regardless of someone's experience with HPC or their desired application. Before I became a full-time HPC support specialist, I also recevied a PhD from Northwestern, specializing in geomicrobiology.

My PhD research focused on understanding the microbial ecology of cave ecosystems. Specifically, I was interested in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen between and among different types of communities in lava tubes and limestone caves. I employed a combination of laboratory and computational tools to pursue this, while also being very fortunate to work in beautifully surreal ecosystems. My research record concerned topics like the flow of carbon to microbes in [Mars-analog lava tubes](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/earthly-lava-tubes-may-offer-insights-into-extraterrestrial-life), modeling the structure of microbial communities in caves and cenotes representing the [eastern Yucatán carbonate aquifer](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/11/yucatans-underwater-caves-host-diverse-microbial-communities/), and recovering microbial genomes from biofilms and sediments within Mammoth Cave, KY.
