Today I describe how to color the terminal ends of a dendrogram based on some metadata variable you want to define. If you would just like to see the code, click [here][code].

Most of the projects I work on involve some sort of clustering analysis. For one of them, I wanted to color the ends of a dendrogram by some variable from my metadata, to visualize whether that variable followed the clustering. There exist excellent packages in R like [ggdendro][ggdendro] that allow you to either plot colored bars under dendrograms to represent how groups cluster or color the terminal segments by the cluster itself. 

That said, I still haven't found an easy way to change the color of the terminal ends of the dendrogram itself based on user-defined metadata, which I personally think can be more visually appealing in some situations. This tutorial describes how I figured out how to do it and provides reproducible [code][code] if you are hoping to do the same thing!

#### Dendrogram Basics

Before I start, what is a dendrogram, anyway?

A dendrogram is a graphical representation of [hierarchical clustering][stat-how-to]. Clusters can be made in different ways (i.e., top-down or bottom-up), most commonly in R through the application of `hclust()` on a distance matrix. Dendrograms are built by connecting nodes to branches or other nodes, resulting in a tree-like figure that shows how individual things are related to each other based on multiple variables. 

Let's say we want to compare how invidual irises relate to each other in the well-known [R-core data set][iris]. This dataframe contains four numeric vectors (`Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length,` and `Petal.Width`) as well as one character vector (`Species`). We could easily construct and plot a dendrogram incorporating all these numeric data with base R, but what if we want to color the terminal segments by the species of iris to visualize whether `Species` follows the clustering determined by `hclust()`?

#### Step 1: Install Packages

For this tutorial, you'll want to load three R packages: `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization, `ggdendro` to extract dendrogram segment data into a dataframe, and `RColorBrewer` to make an automatic custom color palette for your dendrogram ends. If you would like to make your dendrogram interactive, be sure to load `plotly` as well.

```{r, step1, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggdendro, RColorBrewer, plotly)
```

#### Step 2: Load Data

Now we'll want to load the `iris` dataframe into our environment. Typically, we have sample names mapped to each observation, so we will want to create our own (`sample_name`) right at the start. 

With microbial community data, I usually work with two objects: a giant matrix of ASV abundances by `sample_name`, and metadata associated with each sample. To simulate this, we will separate `iris` into `numeric_data`, from which we will calculate distance and construct a dendrogram, and `metadata`, which consists simply of the species of iris for each sample. For this workflow, it is important to have a `sample_name` identifier for each observation; it will be the basis of merging everything at the end.

```{r, step2, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# label rows with unique sample_name
dat <- iris %>%
  mutate(sample_name = paste("iris", seq(1:nrow(iris)), sep = "_")) # create unique sample ID

# save non-numeric metadata in separate dataframe
metadata <- dat %>%
  select(sample_name, Species) 

# extract numeric vectors for distance matrix
numeric_data <- dat %>%
  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, sample_name)

# check data 
head(numeric_data)
```

#### Step 3: Normalize Data and Create Dendrogram

Before we make the dendrogram, we will calculate a distance matrix based on `numeric_data` using `dist()`. It is good practice to normalize your data before doing this calculation; I will therefore normalize all values within a vector on a scale from 0 to 1.

After we do that, we can create a distance matrix (`dist_matrix`) and generate a `dendrogram` from our normalized data.

```{r, step3, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# normalize data to values from 0 to 1 
numeric_data_norm <- numeric_data %>%
  select(sample_name, everything()) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:ncol(.), values_to = "value", names_to = "type") %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  mutate(value_norm = (value-min(value))/(max(value)-min(value))) %>% # normalize data to values 0-1
  select(sample_name, value_norm) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "type", values_from = "value_norm") %>%
  column_to_rownames("sample_name")

# create dendrogram from distance matrix of normalized data
dist_matrix <- dist(numeric_data_norm, method = "euclidean")
dendrogram <- as.dendrogram(hclust(dist_matrix, method = "complete"))
```

#### Step 4: Extract Dendrogram Segment Data Using ggdendro

Now let's quickly take a look at what our dendrogram looks like using base R:

```{r, baseR, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
plot(dendrogram)
```

Okay, it's not very pretty, but bear with me. This is a useful visual to show how we will extract the coordinate data from the dendrogram object with `ggdendro::dendro_data()` to make a better figure. Every dendrogram is plotted by adding individual segments between points on an x and y grid. 

When we apply `ggdendro::dendro_data()` and look at the extracted segment data, we see there are four vectors for every dendrogram: `x`, `y`, `xend`, and `yend`. Every horizontal or vertical line you see in the base R figure is ultimately constructed from one row of the following dataframe:

```{r, extract_dendro, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# extract dendrogram segment data
dendrogram_data <- dendro_data(dendrogram)
dendrogram_segments <- dendrogram_data$segments # contains all dendrogram segment data

head(dendrogram_segments)
```

We will split these coordinate data into two dataframes: `dendrogram_segments`, containing all the segments, and `dendrogram_ends`, containing only the terminal branches of the figure. As the plot above shows, when the value in the y-direction as 0 (i.e., `yend == 0`), that only includes those single segments at the bottom of the plot:

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# get terminal dendrogram segments
dendrogram_ends <- dendrogram_segments %>%
  filter(yend == 0) %>% # filter for terminal dendrogram ends
  left_join(dendrogram_data$labels, by = "x") %>% # .$labels contains the row names from dist_matrix (i.e., sample_name)
  rename(sample_name = label) %>%
  left_join(metadata, by = "sample_name") # dataframe now contains only terminal dendrogram segments and merged metadata associated with each iris
```

Looking at `dendrogram_ends`, we now have a dataframe with vectors containing the dendrogram coordinate data matched to the `sample_name` and `Species` vector. We are now ready to start plotting in ggplot2!

```{r, step4_5, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
head(dendrogram_ends)
```

#### Step 5: Generate a Custom Color Palette for Dendrogram Ends Based on Metadata Variables using RColorBrewer (Optional)

If you want to dynamically create a list of colors based on how many unique variables the metadata vector of interest contains, you can run this code. In this example, our `metadata` only contains three species of iris, so this could be done manually fairly quickly. However, if the number of unique species in your dataset is more than that, as is common with microbial community data, chances are you might want to automate this process. 

```{r, step5, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Generate custom color palette for dendrogram ends based on metadata attribute
unique_vars <- levels(factor(dendrogram_ends$Species)) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% rownames_to_column("row_id") 

# count number of unique variables
color_count <- length(unique(unique_vars$.))
# RColorBrewer
get_palette <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(n = 8, name = "Set1"))

# produce RColorBrewer palette based on number of unique variables in metadata
palette <- get_palette(color_count) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rename("color" = ".") %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "row_id")
color_list <- left_join(unique_vars, palette, by = "row_id") %>%
  select(-row_id)
species_color <- as.character(color_list$color)
names(species_color) <- color_list$.
```

If you don't want to bother with the above code for this tutorial, you could manually create a named character vector as an alternative:

```{r, manual_color, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Alternatively, create a custom named vector for iris species color:
species_color <- c("setosa" = "#E41A1C", "versicolor" = "#CB6651", "virginica" =  "#F781BF")
```

#### Step 6: Plot your Custom-Colored Dendrogram!

Now it's time to plot our dendrogram! You will want to define two geoms for geom_segment: one plotting all the segment data extracted from Step 4, which are uncolored, and one for just the terminal branches of the dendrogram, which is what we will color with `name_color` from the previous step. If you wrap this plot this with plotly (see below), I recommend adding an extra `text` aesthetic to control which information will display on your output.

```{r, step6, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'left'}
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_segment(data = dendrogram_segments, 
               aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend)) +
  geom_segment(data = dendrogram_ends,
               aes(x=x, y=y.x, xend=xend, yend=yend, color = Species, text = paste('sample name: ', sample_name,
                                                                                   '<br>',
                                                                                   'species: ', Species))) + # test aes is for plotly
  scale_color_manual(values = species_color) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  coord_flip() + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "none") + ylab("Distance") + # flipped x and y coordinates for aesthetic reasons
  ggtitle("Iris dendrogram")
  
p
```

If you want to get really fancy, you can wrap your ggplot with [plotly][plotly] to make your dendrogram interactive! Be sure to specify `tooltip = "text"` to control which information is displayed.

```{r, step6_5, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.align = 'left'}
p.lotly <- ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")
```
```{r, step7, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
p.lotly %>%
      htmlwidgets::saveWidget(.,
                              file="../images/colored_dendrogram.html",
                              selfcontained = T)
```
